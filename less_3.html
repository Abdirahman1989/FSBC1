    <p><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/best-first-programming-language" target="_blank">Programming </a>is a
        profession that uses a deep roster of languages, database models, frameworks, and
        much more. In
        addition, different classifications exist within these tools, such as high-level and low-level programming
        languages. With all the technologies and types out there, it can be challenging for a student to decipher not
        only what to be learning, but also <strong> to be learning.</strong></p>
    <P>Many people gain their programming education through universities and leave with a shiny piece of paper vouching
        for their skills. Despite what tradition may imply, college is not the right path for many developing
        programmers, <strong> and the industry knows it.</strong> Factors such as expenses, responsibilities, and other
        obstacles that
        appear in all of our lives can put college out of reach for some people. Add to that the recent explosion in
        online learners and resources, and many hiring managers have recognized that college is not the end-all-be-all
        it is advertised as.</P>
    <p>If you can learn to code well (and can prove it), you can become a programmer with any educational background!

    <h2>You can do it!</h2>
    <P>Before you can successfully learn programming outside of the university environment, it is critical that you
        understand that your goal is immensely attainable. As mentioned in our key takeaways from the 2022 Stack
        Overflow survey, around 23% of professional developers in 2022 are working without a degree. The number of
        students learning to program with online resources is increasing every year, and so is the number of new
        industry professionals with no bachelor’s degree.

        Not only do you have the ability to learn everything you need to become a professional developer with online
        resources and platforms, but you also have a real opportunity to pursue employment with whatever educational
        background you may have. Programming is an occupation where constant learning and growth is a shared trait
        between the most senior and newest employees. A degree is not a prevailing indication that all knowledge has
        been obtained. No matter what degree you hold, you will be a student for the rest of your career in order to
        keep up with the unpredictable industry of technology.</P>
    <div id="Why_CS">
        <h2>Why a computer science degree is not the right choice for everybody
        </h2>
    </div>
    <P>Since every programmer is inherently a learner, the most expensive and time-consuming learning option is not
        necessarily the optimal option for every future programmer out there. University tuition in the United States
        has
        been on the rise[1] for the past few decades, with no sign of slowing down.</P>

    <P>Even with available scholarships and loans, pursuing a traditional bachelor’s degree (let alone a more
        advanced
        degree) is a costly and debt-inducing venture for a lot of students. If budgeting for a bachelor’s degree is not
        feasible for you at this time, there is no need to feel hopeless as you can learn the exact same material and
        skills
        via different paths. A truly great gift of our internet age is that information and education are no longer
        reserved
        for the select few who can pay hefty tuition fees.</P>

    <p>The common university environment is also not the ideal situation for every learner. Suppose you’re reskilling
        from
        another profession, learning part-time with family obligations, or need to work part-time while learning to
        become a
        programmer. In that case, the rigorous curriculum of a college course isn’t necessarily the best choice. The
        flexibility to learn at your own pace (at a fraction of the cost) while being able to focus on the other
        essential
        tasks is a huge upside to individual learning.</p>

    <P>Many capable people don’t thrive in the traditional educational environment of a single instructor assigning
        tests,
        materials, and assignments. Rather than compete for the individual attention of the professor against an army of
        confused peers, many people find it much easier to be in charge of how they’re learning. Online learning
        provides a
        great option for eager students who have always felt more comfortable learning outside of the classroom setting.
    </P>

    <P> Beyond all the personal reasons why college may not be the perfect learning option for you, it is key to
        remember
        that you don’t need to force the university system to work for you if it isn’t working, or won’t work for you.
        There
        are other viable roads to achieving the education you desire that operate at your own speed. Even better,
        programmers are learning and getting hired every day from these alternate educational platforms!</P>

        <h2>Learning options and how to prove your knowledge</h2>
    </Div>
    <p>There are several popular options for learning outside of the university bubble. By completing a combination of
        courses, certifications, projects, and/or boot camps you will not only learn the same skills as a university
        student would learn, but you will also receive reliable documentation to prove that you’ve learned them. At the
        beginning of your journey, it is beneficial to mix a variety of these resources in your routine to get a sense
        of what blend works best for you.</p>

    <h3>Online courses</h3>
    <p>Online courses allow students to take courses produced by industry experts looking to share their knowledge with
        the next wave of programmers. Some sought-after qualities of a reputable course provider are:</p>
    <UL>
        <li>Text-based and interactive environments/coursework</li>
        <li>Personalized learning plans</li>
        <li>Skill-level assessments</li>
        <li> Reinforcing quizzes</li>
        <li> Informative visuals</li>
        <li> Detailed interview preparation</li>
        <li> A variety of courses and paths for students of all levels</li>
        <li> Relevant coursework for all chapters of your learning journey and career</li>
        <li>Courses produced by experienced industry professionals and/or educators</li>
    </UL>
    <P>Structured courses and paths leave no mystery about what is prerequisite knowledge and what to be learning next
        (and how to learn it). A successful online course will present the same information, and teach it in a similar
        fashion, as you would learn in undergraduate computer science programs. Learning from online courses will take
        some more self-motivation without grades and deadlines to worry about, but it’s worth it since you’ll be gaining
        the same education at your own pace, and at a much cheaper price.</P>
    <p>Even after you’ve secured a job as a programmer, online courses are still of value. Professional developers need
        to upskill constantly to keep up with the fluctuating tech world, so getting into the habit of taking online
        courses — especially ones that are created specifically for developers — is a great idea that will benefit your
        career for years to come! Having access to a plethora of online courses also makes it possible to pick up a new
        skill or language whenever you please. If you’re someone who loves learning, then this boundless resource is
        sure to speak to you.
