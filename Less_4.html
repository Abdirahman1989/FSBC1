        <p><strong>Wow.</strong></p>
        <p>A BIG political moment.
        </p>
        <P>For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement of intent from the new
            prime
            minister and new chancellor.
        </P>
        <P>And it is a gamble.</P>
        <p>It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both the ones adopted by Conservative
            governments over the last 12 years (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour
            before
            that.</p>
        <P>It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.
        </P>
        <P>But they can't be certain their approach will work, nor the methods they have chosen to deliver it will be
            popular.</P><br>And then there are the side effects.

        <p>The markets are jittery. The value of the pound is slumping and the cost of government borrowing is rising,
            just
            when the government has said it going to borrow a shedload more money. A few around here with a taste for
            political history have been making comparisons with the so-called 'Barber boom'.</p>
        <P>A senior Labour figure was the
            first to mention it to me just as Kwasi Kwarteng prepared to get to his feet in the Commons.</P>
        <P>And a few hours later, so did Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

        </P>
        <P>The Barber boom is a reference to the stint in the Treasury of former Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber,
            when Ted Heath was prime minister.
        </P>
        <p>Mr Barber cut taxes big time, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/1573242663771447296">particularly in
                1972</a> - it being the only Budget in the last half
            century to cut taxes more than Kwasi Kwarteng just has.
        </p>
        <p>Mr Barber wanted a "dash for growth". He borrowed money, cut taxes and the economy grew.
        </p>
        <p>But strikes, unemployment and inflation followed, and the Conservatives lost the next general election.
        </p>
        <p>Things are different now: unemployment is low, the Bank of England controls interest rates.

        </p>
        <P>But don't be surprised if we hear more of Mr Barber's stewardship of the economy in the coming months,
            particularly from those sceptical about Mr Kwarteng's plans.

        </P>
        <p>So, given the risks, and the historical precedent, why is the government choosing this approach?

        </p>
        <P>They argue this is a calculated and worthwhile thing to do, because to do nothing, to maintain the status
            quo,
            would be a bigger gamble still.

        </P>
        <P>And yes, growth has been sluggish for years and years, and the economy teeters on the edge of - or is perhaps
            already in - recession.

        </P>
        <P>So few would dispute doing something to catalyse the economy, one way or another.

        </P>
        <P>They do, though, have a big persuasion job on their hands, including, incidentally, among some on their own
            side.

        </P>

        <P>There is a bunch of Conservative MPs who have never warmed to Liz Truss, and some who are hostile towards her
            political instincts.

        </P>
        <P>One or two have already said as much publicly, others are keeping their thoughts to themselves for now.</P>
        <P>Some fret the plan doesn't look fair, given the scale of the tax cuts for the richest.

        </P>
        <P>Others see it as a sugar hit for the economy which runs the risk, they fear, of stoking inflation further.
        </P>
        <P>For others though, in the parliamentary party and among the grassroots, this is a moment they can gladly
            cheer:
            what they see as a properly Conservative budget after all those years of coalition compromise, Brexit and
            Covid.

        </P>
        <P>Which brings us to the coming political argument: the government hopes this set of measures will give the
            economy
            a giant injection of oomph.

        </P>
        <P>It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are
            bold
            and stark.

        </P>
