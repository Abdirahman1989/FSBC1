        <P>If you’re a <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/tips-self-taught-developers">self-taught dev</a> or new to
            software development, it can be challenging to identify what tools and

        <P>As a new or aspiring developer, using project management tools can help you keep track of your progress, and
            even build a portfolio of projects to show potential employers. If you’re tired of starting projects but
            never finishing them, it might be time to try a project management tool or two.
        </P>

            <P>These measures may seem like overkill at first. Still, suppose you’re at the learning phase where you’re
                ready to start building apps and websites for your portfolio. In that case, these project management
                basics
                can save precious time and energy that would have otherwise been spent on miscellaneous administrative
                tasks.</P>

            <P>Learning to use these tools and methods will also give you a head start when it comes time to work with
                project management tools in professional settings. Generally speaking, if you learn how to use one
                project
                management tool, you’ll learn how to use them all. Trello, Asana, and Jira are all tools used in
                enterprise
                settings.</P>

        <h3>1.<strong> Use a personal Kanban board:</strong> Trello, Asana, and Jira
        </h3>
        <P>Kanban boards help developers track the progress of their projects by breaking them down into cards with
            smaller tasks.
        </P>
        <P>These cards are then placed in columns on the board, representing the different development stages. This
            helps developers track their progress by giving them a visual representation of how far along they are in
            the project.
        </P>
        <P>Kanban boards are a popular way for agile and DevOps teams to organize their daily work <sup><a
                    href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>, and
            can be a
            great way for new developers to commit to getting their projects across the finish line!
        </P>
        <P>There are many different Kanban boards available, and three popular ones are <strong>Trello</strong>,
            <strong>Asana</strong>, and <strong>Jira</strong>

        <P> Trello is a great option for new developers. It’s simple to use and has a free tier that allows you to
            create an unlimited number of boards with up to 10 team members. Once you get the hang of it, you can try
            out more feature-rich options like Asana or Jira.</P>

        <P>Jira is more commonly used in enterprise settings, so if you want to work at a large company, there’s a good
            chance you’ll use it at some point in your career.</P>
